## A Game Review on Rogue Company

COVID-19 has brought stress upon many people and forced them in situations where they are in the house for the majority of the day. Although the circumstances are not ideal, it has brought many people to pick up video games for the first time and let way for people who have always enjoyed them to devote some more time into gaming.

One of these games, that was recently released on the Epic Games Store and published by Hi-Rez studios, is Rogue Company.

### What is Rogue Company?

Rogue Company is a 4v4 third person shooter where two teams compete in three gamemodes: Demolition, Strikeout, or Extraction. Of these gamemodes, I will be focusing mainly on Demolition. In demolition, players begin by choosing a Rogue, or an agent. Each Rogue has different abilities and passive abilities, along with a different set of skills and weapons they are able to choose from to buy. For example, the Rogue Dima has the ability to pull out a MIRV Launcher, which is a cluster grenade launcher, and has access to the KA30 (assault rifle) and the Mamba (DMR) while the Rogue Ronin has the ability to use a Ballistic Knife, which is a throwable explosive knife, and has access to the KA30 (assault rifle) and SL-C (SMG). Both these rogues have different abilities but hold a different set of guns they are able to choose to purchase as well as a slew of different passive perks they can choose to buy throughout the game. After choosing their Rogue, players will enter the shop where they choose what they want to bring into the round, whether it be grenades, tripmines, katanas, or a new weapon, and they will then be launched into the field. In Demolition, the players will work together to either protect the two sites (A and B) from be exploded by a bomb or they will be attacking the sites to try to blow it up. The first team to successfully complete their objective seven times will win.
