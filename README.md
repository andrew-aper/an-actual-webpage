## A Game Review on Rogue Company

COVID-19 has brought stress upon many people and forced them in situations where they are in the house for the majority of the day. Although the circumstances are not ideal, it has brought many people to pick up video games for the first time and let way for people who have always enjoyed them to devote some more time into gaming.

One of these games, that was recently released on the Epic Games Store and published by Hi-Rez studios, is Rogue Company.

### What is Rogue Company?

Rogue Company is a 4v4 third person shooter where two teams compete in three gamemodes: Demolition, Strikeout, or Extraction. Of these gamemodes, I will be focusing mainly on Demolition. In demolition, players begin by choosing a Rogue, or an agent. 

Each Rogue has different abilities and passive abilities, along with a different set of skills and weapons they are able to choose from to buy. For example, the Rogue Dima has the ability to pull out a MIRV Launcher, which is a cluster grenade launcher, and has access to the KA30 (assault rifle) and the Mamba (DMR) while the Rogue Ronin has the ability to use a Ballistic Knife, which is a throwable explosive knife, and has access to the KA30 (assault rifle) and SL-C (SMG). Both these rogues have different abilities but hold a different set of guns they are able to choose to purchase as well as a slew of different passive perks they can choose to buy throughout the game. 

After choosing their Rogue, players will enter the shop where they choose what they want to bring into the round, whether it be grenades, tripmines, katanas, or a new weapon, and they will then be launched into the field. In Demolition, the players will work together to either protect the two sites (A and B) from be exploded by a bomb or they will be attacking the sites to try to blow it up. The first team to successfully complete their objective seven times will win.

### So should you play Rogue Company?

After playing the game for a few hours, I can safely say that the game is quite enjoyable with friends. The game is extremely easy to pick up and is a great way to relax with friends in a semi-competitive environment or in a completely casual way. How you play the game is up to you and you can completely screw around or play to win. For me personally, I do not think this game would be as enjoyable as a solo player. Finding three other people who have some time to play a few games is an excellent way to destress. Since the game has flew under the radar for the past few months, there are not many players and the skill gap has not grown so wide that it is impossible for more casual players or newbies to try to pick up the game for fun. So the simple answer is yes, you should play the game if you can find a few other people to play it with. 

It is a tactical third person shooter that can provide a few hours of enjoyment. However, in the long-term I do not find this as a game that you would play. The competetive aspect or rather the lack thereof seems to be hurting the game, at least from my perspective. The only goal that seems present in the game is playing to unlock new Rogues, however the grind is not for some players and it can be quick to get tired of (as the grind takes a while). I am enjoying the game on-and-off with friends as of right now, but that might or might not stand. The game is entertaining and can make for some funny moments and clips with your friends, so you should definitely try it out!
